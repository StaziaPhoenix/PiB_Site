				<p>Here at Project in a Box, our vision is to bring engineering back to its roots - people inventing things for the good of their community. We aim to bring interactive learning to every stage of education so that students can readily apply scientific theory to real, practical engineering applications. All of our curriculum is hands-on, and gives students something tangible to produce and take home while training them in a range of design and prototyping skillsets.</p>

				<p>Our name is a relic of our roots: a team of engineering students at UC San Diego who designed our first projects, fully documented them, and put all of the materials in a kit - the box - that we could hand to a fellow student. Thus, each project is a standalone product utilizing a set of development skills that we could pass on to our fellow students with a simple box. Today, we have expanded to reach out to our greater community, but we keep the box-mentality of knowledge sharing in all of our ventures.</p>

				<p>In order to serve a range of demographics, PiB is split into four divisions - poke around below to identify which division is right for you.</p>
